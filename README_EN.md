- 🎛️ Full KDE graphical interface integration
- 🔐 Fully encrypted configuration (Fernet + password)
- 💾 Configurations can be saved/exported and imported (password required for import)
- 🔑 Password-based authentication (SMB, FTP) or key-based authentication (SFTP)
- 💻 Automatic mounting at system startup
- 🔁 Background daemon detects and unmounts unreachable SMB mounts (e.g. on network change)
- 🌍 Multilingual support (currently Hungarian and English)
- 🧽 Automatic creation, removal and maintenance of KDE bookmarks for all mounted shares
- 🔧 Fully tested on Nobara KDE – optimized for this distribution.

## 🚀 Installation

Run the following:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-pyqt6 sshfs curlftpfs cifs-utils sshpass fuse-sshfs curlftpfs git
```
This installs the necessary system packages (if not already present).

### Option 1: From GitHub Releases (ZIP)

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/dension0/NetMountManager/releases/latest)
2. Download the file `Source code (zip)` under **Assets**
3. Extract the ZIP to your home directory (e.g. `/home/username/NetMountManager/`)
4. Run:
```bash
cd ~/NetMountManager
```
```bash
python3 install.py
```
### Option 2: Clone via Git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dension0/NetMountManager.git ~/NetMountManager
```
```bash
cd ~/NetMountManager
```
```bash
python3 install.py
```
This will:

Install required Python packages (PyQt6, cryptography)

Create a .desktop launcher in your application menu

Set up background services that activate automatically on first launch:
```bash
~/.config/autostart/net-automounts.desktop
```
```bash
~/.config/systemd/user/smb-unmount.service
```

⚠️ Admin password may be requested for encryption and mount operations (e.g. mounting SMB shares).

---

## ❌ Uninstallation

Run:
```bash
python3 ~/NetMountManager/uninstall.py
```
This will:

Remove the application menu entry

Remove the autostart desktop file

Disable and remove the background unmounting daemon (systemd user service)

⚠️ The encrypted config file (.net_mounts.secure) is not deleted automatically.

---

## 🛠️ Optional Python Package Removal
These packages are used by NetMountManager:

pip uninstall pyqt6 cryptography

Only use this if you're sure no other tools depend on them.

---

## 📥 Export / Import Configuration
You can export your configuration to a .secure encrypted file.

On import, you must enter the password used during encryption.

Imported entries are automatically merged with existing ones (duplicates will prompt for replacement).

---

## 🔐 Encryption System
Fernet encryption (AES 128 GCM)

Key derivation: PBKDF2HMAC (SHA256, 100,000 iterations)

Salt is derived from the MD5 hash of the admin password

Encrypted configuration stored at: data/.net_mounts.secure
